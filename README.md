# TutorFlow üöÄ

**A personalized linear algebra tutor prototype using AI.**

## Overview
TutorFlow is a prototype educational technology project that provides **adaptive, vibe-coded feedback** to students learning linear algebra concepts. It demonstrates:

- **Prompt Engineering**: structured AI instructions for step-by-step guidance.
- **Context Engineering**: simple student memory to personalize responses.
- **Vibe Coding**: encouraging, Socratic, or analytical AI ‚Äútones.‚Äù

## Features (MVP)
1. Input a math problem or reflection.
2. Receive AI-generated step-by-step feedback.
3. Store student interactions for context-aware responses.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tutorflow.git
